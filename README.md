## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Load and inspect the dataset for null values and structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Feature scaling  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualization of salary distribution  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Feature relationships

4. **Model Training**  
   - Train/test split  
   - Try multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)  
   - Evaluate models with metrics like R², MAE, RMSE

5. **Model Selection and Testing**  
   - Choose the best model  
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters  
   - Predict salaries on new/unseen data
